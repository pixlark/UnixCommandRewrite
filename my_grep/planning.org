* Planning

** Line-by-Line

Move through the characters until you encounter a newline. If the
search term wasn't detected in the line, move on. Otherwise:

** Term-by-Term

Move through the characters in the line and find all the points where
the search term is included. Push these onto a queue. Return to the
beginning of the line.

** Character-by-Character

Move through the characters in the line. When you reach each term
position, change to red color for the duration of the term.
